This tkinter program will calculate 2 possible things: the chance at least 1 of a number of events will occur, and the chance all of them will occur, and the chance none will occur. These features are closely related and could be calculated with one additional calculation from each other, but I don't want to whip out my calculator each time. More complex calculations will be added later.
